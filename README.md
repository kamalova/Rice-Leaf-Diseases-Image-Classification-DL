##  Overview and Business Statement
Rice is one of the most cultivated crops in the world, in over a hundred countries. As per reports by interest groups, rice consists of a total harvested area of approximately 158 million hectares, producing more than 700 million tons annually (470 million tons of milled rice). With rice being such a valuable commodity, a common problem that widespread cultivators face is infestation of rice leaf diseases. Infection by diseases results in great loss to economic to the farmers in every year.

In traditional practices, identification is performed either by visual observation or by testing in laboratory. The visual observation requires expertise and it may vary subject to an individual which may lead to an error while the laboratory test is time consuming and may not be able to provide the results in time. Taking into consideration the large range of possible diseases, it becomes a difficult task for cultivators to individually identify these cases, especially for large fields. 
  
In an effort to solve this problem and assist farmers and everyday gardeners to ensure a healthy crop, **Leaf Green** uses an image classification model to help predict and identify three common leaf diseases  *(Brown Spot, Leaf Blast, Hispa)*  based on images of both healthy and diseased rice plant leaves.
  
  ## Data Understanding
 The data was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nizorogbezuode/rice-leaf-images dataset . The images are in 4 folders, classified as follows:<p>

  Natural Green leaves indicate **healthy** rice plants.

 **Brown Spot (Helminthosporiose)**  is the one of the major fungal diseases in rice in which it is caused by Bipolarisoryzae. The fungus can survive in the seed for more than four years and can spread from plant to plant through air.

 **Hispa** scrapes the upper surface of leaf blades leaving only the lower epidermis. It also tunnels through the leaf tissues. When damage is severe, plants become less vigorous. The presence of grassy weeds in and near rice fields as alternate hosts harbor and encourage the pest to develop.

 **Leaf Blast** *(leaf and collar)* is caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. It can affect all above ground parts of a rice plant: leaf, collar, node, neck, parts of panicle, and sometimes leaf sheath. Rice can have blast in all growth stages.
